# homebridge-sengled (Beta)
An unoffical [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) platform plugin for Sengled accessories.

## Features for lamps:

- State (on / off)
- Hue (numeric value)
- Brightness (numeric value)

Note that I only have **Element Classic A19 Kit (Light bulbs + Hub)** to test.
https://us.sengled.com/products/element-classic-kit  

This plugin uses the existing Sengled Element Home app infrastructure to allow you to control your Sengled accessories.

Provide your username and password and register as a platform, and it will auto-detect the light bulb you have registered.

This plugin is still in beta.
